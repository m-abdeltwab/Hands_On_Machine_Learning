How often you need to do that depends on the use case: if the model classifies pictures of cats and dogs, its performance will decay very slowly, but if the model deals with fast-evolving systems, for example making predictions on the financial market, then it is likely to decay quite fast. \n",

Fortunately, the whole process of training, evaluating, and launching a machine learning system can be automated fairly easily (as we saw in Figure 1-3), so even a batch learning system can adapt to change.

    "- In online learning, you train the system incrementally by feeding it data instances sequentially, either individually or in small groups called **mini-batches**. Each learning step is fast and cheap, so the system can learn about new data on the fly, as it arrives\n",

    "</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Additionally, online learning algorithms can be used to train models on huge datasets that cannot fit in one machine’s main memory (this is called **out-of-core learning**). The algorithm loads part of the data, runs a training step on that data, and repeats the process until it has run on all of the data.\n",
    "<img src=\"images/15.png\" width=\"800\" >\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- One important parameter of online learning systems is how fast they should adapt to changing data: this is called the **learning rate**. If you set a high learning rate, then your system will rapidly adapt to new data, but it will also tend to quickly forget the old data (and you don’t want a spam filter to flag only the latest kinds of spam it was shown). \n",
    "</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Conversely, if you set a low learning rate, the system will have more inertia; that is, it will learn more slowly, but it will also be less sensitive to noise in the new data or to sequences of nonrepresentative data points (outliers).\n",
    "\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Out-of-core learning** is usually done offline (not on the live system), so online learning can be a confusing name. Think of it as incremental learning.\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- A big challenge with online learning is that if bad data is fed to the system, the system’s performance will decline, possibly quickly (depending on the data quality and learning rate). If it’s a live system, your clients will notice. For example, bad data could come from a bug (a malfunctioning sensor on a robot), or it could come from someone trying to game the system (spamming a search engine to try to rank high in search results). To reduce this risk, you need to monitor your system closely and promptly switch learning off (and possibly revert to a previously working state) if you detect a drop in performance. You may also want to monitor the input data and react to abnormal data; for example, using an anomaly detection algorithm"
